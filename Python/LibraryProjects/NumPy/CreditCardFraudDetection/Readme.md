# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud detection is undoubtedly one of the easiest NumPy beginner projects you will come across. Using specific predictive models, you will forecast credit card fraud in the transactional dataset in this project. Use Kaggle's credit card fraud detection dataset for this project. You will use a wide range of Python libraries in this project, including Numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, etc. You can efficiently work with the two validation matrices- recall matrix and precision matrix, using Numpy. This is one of the most fun NumPy projects in Python to work on since it will show you how organizations constantly rely on machine learning techniques to identify credit card fraud.
