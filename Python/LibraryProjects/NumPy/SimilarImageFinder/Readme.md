# Similar Image Finder

## Problem Statement

The similar image finder project is one of the most simple NumPy projects for final-year students and beginner-level professionals. The project's goal is to create a model that, using an image as input, generates images similar to the image the user originally provided. Online retail websites like Amazon, Flipkart, and others use recommendations for related products based on product images. Use the iMaterialist Challenge dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of images from 2,019 product categories, each with a unique ground truth class label. You will use 1,011,532 images for training, 10,095 for validation, and 90,834 for testing. If you are looking for beginner-friendly Python NumPy projects, you should try working on this one.
