# Collaborative Filtering Recommender System

## Problem Statement

One of the most useful NumPy sample projects is the collaborative filtering recommender system project. This machine learning project entails developing a collaborative filtering recommender system by employing a memory-based technique of distance proximity with cosine distances and nearest neighbors. Use the 2 million-record Amazon Reviews/Ratings dataset to develop the recommender system. Use cosine similarity to identify K-top users who are similar to you. You can categorize the movies each user likes into one group after identifying the k other users who are similar to them. You can start recommending the movies in this group to user who hasn't seen them yet.
