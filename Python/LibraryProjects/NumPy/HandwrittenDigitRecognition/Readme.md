# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Problem Statement

The goal of this handwritten digit recognition project is to accurately detect handwritten digits and be able to save them digitally in one location. Using the MNIST dataset, you will develop a convolutional neural network for handwritten digit recognition. The NumPy package will come in handy while working on this project. The testing dataset features 10,000 grayscale images of handwritten numerals from 0 to 9, while the training database has 60,000 grayscale photos of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, each measuring 28x 28 pixels. Try searching for ‘NumPy projects GitHub’ on Google, and you will find more details about this project.
